# PowerBrief Web Assets - Fixed Implementation

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Redirect Issue Fixed**
- **Problem**: When first creating a web asset brief, it redirected to a brief like the ad brief, then required closing and reopening to show the new brief.
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote the web-assets page to follow the email brief pattern with proper concept management and state handling.

### 2. **Concept Creation Issues Fixed**
- **Problem**: Clicking "new web asset concept" took a long time and duplicated concepts when pressed multiple times.
- **Solution**: Implemented proper loading states and disabled buttons during creation to prevent duplicate submissions.

### 3. **Living Document Implementation**
- **Problem**: The brief wasn't a living, breathing document that could be manually edited.
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive form-based interface with:
  - All fields manually editable
  - Auto-save functionality (2-second debounce)
  - Real-time state management
  - Proper form validation

### 4. **Team Assignment Fields Added**
- **Problem**: Missing strategist, editor/designer fields like in ads brief.
- **Solution**: Added complete team assignment section:
  - Strategist field
  - Creative Coordinator field  
  - Assigned Designer field
  - All fields auto-save and display in concept cards

### 5. **Inspiration Section Added**
- **Problem**: No inspiration section for visual references.
- **Solution**: Implemented optional inspiration section with:
  - File upload for inspiration images/videos
  - Multiple inspiration links
  - Proper file management (add/remove)

### 6. **Prompt Field Added**
- **Problem**: No dedicated prompt field for AI generation.
- **Solution**: Added "Primary Goal & Prompt" section with:
  - Large textarea for detailed prompts
  - Clear placeholder text
  - Required field validation for AI generation

### 7. **AI Generation with Gemini 2.5**
- **Problem**: AI generation wasn't using the same model as email/ads briefs.
- **Solution**: Integrated with existing AI infrastructure:
  - Uses same `/api/ai/generate-brief` endpoint
  - Gemini 2.5 model (same as email/ads)
  - Proper system instructions for web assets
  - Comprehensive prompt building

### 8. **Asset-Type Specific Forms**
- **Problem**: Form fields weren't different based on asset type selection.
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic asset-specific configurations:

#### Landing Page
- Page Sections (Hero, Features, etc.)
- Responsive Requirements

#### Web Banner  
- Banner Dimensions
- Animation Type (Static, Simple, Complex, Video)

#### Promotional Popup
- Popup Trigger (Time-based, Scroll-based, Exit Intent, Click)
- Popup Size specifications

#### Video Assets (Brand Story, Animation)
- Video Duration
- Video Style (Live Action, Animation, Motion Graphics, Mixed Media)
