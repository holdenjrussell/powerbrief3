# UGC Pipeline Restructure - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive restructuring of the UGC pipeline system as requested. The changes include moving creator statuses to settings, replacing the AI UGC Agent with a new UGC Coordinator dashboard, fixing modal issues, and implementing a complete workflow automation system.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Navigation Restructure
- **Moved Creator Statuses**: Relocated from Automation → Creator Statuses tab to Settings → Creator Statuses
- **Removed Script Pipeline Statuses**: Eliminated the hard-coded script pipeline statuses (rate negotiation, production, delivery) from automation settings
- **Replaced AI UGC Agent**: Changed from "AI UGC Agent" to "UGC Coordinator" in the Automation section
- **Updated Navigation Structure**:
  ```
  Pipeline: Concept View, Script Creation
  Creators: Creator Management, Creator Inbox  
  Automation: UGC Coordinator, Workflow Builder
  Settings: Pipeline Settings, Creator Statuses, Creator Fields, Email Templates
  ```

### 2. New UGC Coordinator Dashboard
Created a comprehensive dashboard (`UgcCoordinatorDashboard.tsx`) with:

#### Dashboard Tab
- **Metrics Cards**: Active workflows, pending reviews, completed today, total creators
- **Recent Activity**: Latest workflow executions with progress bars and status indicators
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Running, completed, failed, pending human review

#### Human Review Tab
- **Review Queue**: Items requiring manual intervention
- **Priority System**: High, medium, low priority reviews
- **Action System**: Contextual actions based on review type
- **Review Dialog**: Detailed review interface with notes and actions

#### Workflow History Tab
- **Complete History**: All workflow executions with search and filtering
- **Execution Details**: Step progress, timing, context information
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by completion status

#### Settings Tab
- **Automation Controls**: Auto-execute workflows, notifications
- **Integration Settings**: Slack and email notifications

### 3. Fixed Modal Issues
Updated `MessageTemplateManager.tsx`:
- **Fixed Modal Positioning**: Added `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` to prevent modal cutoff
- **Conditional Content Section**: Hide content section when AI generated is selected
- **Variable Support for AI**: Show available variables that AI can use when generating content
- **Removed In-App Notifications**: Filtered out notification template type from creation options

### 4. Database Schema Updates
Created migration `20250116000003_add_workflow_execution_tables.sql`:

#### New Tables
- **ugc_workflow_executions**: Track running workflows with status, progress, context
- **ugc_workflow_step_executions**: Track individual step executions
- **ugc_workflow_email_threads**: Link email communications to workflows
- **ugc_workflow_variables**: Store dynamic workflow variables

#### Enhanced Tables
- **ugc_human_intervention_queue**: Added workflow_execution_id reference

#### Security
- **Row Level Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies for all new tables
- **Brand-based Access**: Users can only access workflows for their brands

### 5. API Endpoints
Created new API endpoints:

#### `/api/ugc/workflow/executions`
- Fetch workflow executions for dashboard
- Includes creator and workflow template information
- Supports filtering and pagination

#### `/api/ugc/workflow/human-review`
- Fetch pending human review items
- Includes contextual actions based on review type
- Supports priority filtering

#### `/api/ugc/workflow/human-review/[id]/action`
- Process human review actions
- Update workflow execution status
- Trigger next workflow steps

### 6. Default Workflow Template
Created comprehensive default workflow (`createDefaultWorkflowForBrand`):

#### Complete Creator Journey
1. **Creator Added Trigger**: Workflow starts when creator is added
2. **Source Detection**: Check if from onboarding form or manual entry
3. **Email Validation**: Ensure creator has email for communication
4. **Welcome Communications**: Automated welcome emails
5. **Human Review Points**: Portfolio review, final approval
6. **AI Response Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Pro analyzes creator responses
7. **Rate Negotiation**: Automated negotiation with human escalation
8. **Script Assignment**: Human assigns scripts with AI email drafting
9. **Contract & Shipping**: Conditional checks for contract and product shipment
10. **Content Submission**: Wait for content with automated confirmations
11. **Content Review**: Human review with approval/revision workflow
12. **Completion**: Move to editing phase

#### Human Intervention Points
- **Missing Email**: High priority review when creator lacks email
- **Portfolio Review**: Medium priority creator approval process
- **Rate Negotiation**: High priority for complex negotiations
- **Script Assignment**: Medium priority for script allocation
- **Contract Signing**: High priority for contract management
- **Product Shipment**: High priority for fulfillment
- **Content Review**: Medium priority for content approval

#### AI Integration Points
- **Response Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Pro analyzes creator emails
- **Rate Negotiation**: Automated negotiation with escalation rules
- **Email Drafting**: Context-aware email generation
- **General Responses**: AI handles routine inquiries

### 7. Workflow Features
- **Editable Step Names**: Frontend support for customizing step names
- **Conditional Logic**: Support for complex branching workflows
- **Variable System**: Dynamic variables throughout workflow execution
- **Email Integration**: All communications tracked and available in creator inbox
- **Slack Notifications**: Optional Slack alerts for human review items
- **Timeout Handling**: Automatic reminders and escalations

## Migration Requirements

### Database Migrations to Run
1. `20250116000003_add_workflow_execution_tables.sql` - New workflow execution tables
2. Existing custom status migration should already be in place

### Post-Migration Steps
1. **Regenerate Types**: Run type generation after migrations
2. **Create Default Workflows**: Default workflow will be created for existing brands
3. **Configure Integrations**: Set up Slack webhooks if desired
4. **Test Human Review**: Verify human review queue functionality

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Serverless Considerations
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Workflows designed for serverless execution
- **Stateless Steps**: Each step can be executed independently
- **Database State Management**: All state stored in database, not memory
- **API-Based Triggers**: Workflow progression via API calls

### Performance Optimizations
- **Indexed Queries**: All major query paths have database indexes
- **Pagination Support**: Large datasets handled with pagination
