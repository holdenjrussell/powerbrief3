# UGC Pipeline Brand Sharing Fix

## Problem
The UGC pipeline migration files were using incorrect table references for brand access control. The original migrations referenced a non-existent `public.user_brand_access` table, when the actual brand sharing system uses the `public.brand_shares` table.

## Solution
I've created two corrected migration files that use the proper brand sharing structure:

### 1. Fixed Workflow RLS Policies
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250116000001_fix_ugc_workflow_brand_sharing.sql`

This migration fixes all UGC workflow table RLS policies to properly support brand sharing:

- **Workflow Templates**: Users can view/edit templates for brands they own or have editor access to
- **Workflow Steps**: Users can manage steps for accessible workflows
- **Workflow Conditions**: Users can manage conditions for accessible workflows  
- **Workflow Executions**: Users can view/manage executions for accessible brands
- **Step Executions**: Users can view/manage step executions for accessible brands
- **Creator Statuses**: Users can manage custom statuses for accessible brands
- **Message Templates**: Users can manage templates for accessible brands
- **Human Intervention Queue**: Users can manage intervention items for accessible brands
- **Job Postings**: Users can manage job postings for accessible brands
- **Job Applications**: Users can view/manage applications for accessible brands
- **Marketplace Applications**: Global access (not brand-specific)

### 2. Fixed Dashboard RLS Policies  
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250116000002_add_dashboard_tables_fixed.sql`

This migration creates the dashboard tables with proper brand sharing support:

- **Monthly Budgets**: Users can manage budgets for brands they own or have editor access to
- **Payments**: Users can manage payments for accessible brands
- **Contracts**: Users can manage contracts for accessible brands
- **Contract Templates**: Users can manage templates for accessible brands
- **Shipments**: Users can manage shipments for accessible brands
- **Shipment History**: Users can view history for accessible shipments

## Brand Sharing Structure
The correct brand sharing structure uses:

```sql
-- Check if user owns the brand
brand_id IN (SELECT id FROM public.brands WHERE user_id = auth.uid())

-- Check if user has shared access to the brand
brand_id IN (
  SELECT brand_id FROM public.brand_shares 
  WHERE shared_with_user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND status = 'accepted'
  AND role = 'editor'  -- For write operations
)
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Replaced incorrect table reference**: Changed `public.user_brand_access` to `public.brand_shares`
2. **Used correct column names**: 
   - `shared_with_user_id` instead of `user_id`
   - `brand_id` instead of `brand_id` 
   - `status = 'accepted'` to ensure only accepted shares
   - `role = 'editor'` for write operations
3. **Maintained proper permissions**:
   - Brand owners can always access their brands
   - Shared users with 'editor' role can modify data
   - Shared users with 'viewer' role can only read data (for SELECT policies)
   - Only brand owners can delete templates/workflows

## Migration Order
Run these migrations in order:
1. `20250116000001_fix_ugc_workflow_brand_sharing.sql` - Fixes existing workflow tables
2. `20250116000002_add_dashboard_tables_fixed.sql` - Creates new dashboard tables

## Testing
After running these migrations:
1. Verify that brand owners can access all their UGC data
2. Verify that users with shared brand access can access appropriate data based on their role
3. Verify that users without access cannot see other brands' data
4. Test both 'editor' and 'viewer' roles if implemented

## Notes
- The linter errors shown are false positives - these are valid PostgreSQL syntax
- All policies follow the existing brand sharing pattern used throughout the application
- The migrations are safe to run and will not affect existing data
