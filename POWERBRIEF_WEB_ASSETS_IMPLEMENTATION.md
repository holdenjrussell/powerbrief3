# PowerBrief Web Assets Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the PowerBrief Web Assets feature, which is specifically designed for creating design briefs for web assets only. This implementation eliminates the duplication with the ads version and provides a focused, comprehensive brief builder for web-specific creative assets.

## Branch Information

**Branch:** `powerbrief-web-assets`

This feature is implemented on a dedicated branch to allow for focused development and testing of web asset-specific functionality.

## Key Differences from Ads Version

### 1. Asset Type Focus
- **Ads Version**: Focuses on paid advertising campaigns across platforms (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.)
- **Web Assets Version**: Specifically designed for web assets including:
  - Landing Pages
  - Web Banners (Static/Animated)
  - Promotional Popups/Modals
  - Homepage Heroes
  - Product Explainers
  - Brand Story Videos
  - Animated Logos/Bumpers
  - Video Animations
  - Custom asset types with input saving capability

### 2. Brief Structure

#### Core Creative Idea Section

#### Visual & Sensory Direction
- **Inspiration Gallery**: Upload images or link to URLs (Behance, Dribbble, competitor sites)
- **Look & Feel Keywords**: Visual style descriptors (Minimal & Clean, Bold & Energetic, etc.)
- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, accent colors with HEX codes and avoid colors
- **Typography**: Font family, weights, styles for headlines, body text, and CTAs
- **Mandatory Elements Checklist**:
  - Logo (with version specification)
  - Specific Product Shots
  - Legal Disclaimer/Fine Print
  - Custom elements

#### Asset-Specific Structure & Specs
Different specifications based on asset type:

**For Landing Pages/Web Heroes:**
- Section Flow/Wireframe
- Interactive Notes (hover states, animations)

**For Web Banners:**
- Dimensions (all required ad sizes)
- Animation Sequence for animated banners

**For Videos:**
- Shot List/Storyboard
- Aspect Ratios checklist
- Required End Card specifications

### 3. AI Features

#### Creative Angle Generator
