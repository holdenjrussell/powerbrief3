## Channel Configuration

PowerBrief supports sending different types of notifications to different Slack channels. This allows you to organize your workflow and ensure the right people see the right notifications.

### Default Channel
Set a default channel that will be used for all notifications unless a specific channel is configured for that notification type.

### Specific Channels
Configure specific channels for different notification types:

- **Concept Submissions** - When creators submit concepts for review
- **Revision Requests** - When reviewers request changes to concepts  
- **Concept Approvals** - When concepts are approved and ready for upload
- **Concept Ready for Editor** - When concepts are marked ready for editor/designer review
- **Ad Launches** - When ads are successfully published to Meta

### Channel Priority
The system uses the following priority order when determining which channel to use:

1. **Specific Channel** - If configured for the notification type
2. **Default Channel** - If no specific channel is set
3. **Webhook Default** - If no channels are configured in PowerBrief

### Example Setup
```
Default Channel: #general
Concept Submissions: #creative-submissions  
Revision Requests: #creative-revisions
Concept Approvals: #creative-approvals
Concept Ready for Editor: #creative-ready-for-editor
Ad Launches: #ad-launches
```

With this setup:
- Concept submissions go to `#creative-submissions`
- Revision requests go to `#creative-revisions`  
- Concept approvals go to `#creative-approvals`
- Concepts ready for editor go to `#creative-ready-for-editor`
- Ad launches go to `#ad-launches`
- Any other notifications go to `#general`

## Notification Types

PowerBrief sends notifications for the following events:

### 1. Ad Batch Published

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid webhook URL"**
   - Ensure the URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/`
   - Make sure you copied the complete URL

2. **"Test message failed"**
   - Check that the webhook is still active in your Slack app
   - Verify the channel still exists
   - Ensure the app has permission to post to the channel

3. **"No notifications received"**
   - Check that notifications are enabled in your brand settings
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct
   - Test the webhook using the test button

4. **"Notifications going to wrong channel"**
   - Check your channel configuration in Advanced Settings
   - Verify channel names don't include the # symbol (it's added automatically)
   - Ensure the channels exist and the app has permission to post

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Use the **"Test Webhook"** button in the Slack Integration settings
2. Check the browser console for error messages
3. Verify your Slack app permissions
4. Ensure the webhook URL is correctly copied

## Channel Override

You can specify different channels for notifications in two ways:

### Method 1: Default Channel Override
1. Enter the channel name in the "Default Channel" field (with or without #)
2. This channel will be used for all notifications unless specific channels are configured

### Method 2: Advanced Channel Settings
1. Click "Advanced Channel Settings" to expand the configuration
2. Configure specific channels for each notification type
3. Leave fields empty to use the default channel
4. Channel names can be entered with or without the # symbol

**Important Notes:**
- All channels must exist and the app must have permission to post there
- Channel names are case-sensitive
- Private channels require the app to be invited to the channel

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs are stored securely in your database
- Only users with access to your brand can configure Slack settings
- Webhook URLs can be regenerated in Slack if compromised
- No sensitive ad data is included in notifications (only names and counts)
- Public share links in notifications are the same ones you would manually share with team members

## Workflow Integration

The Slack notifications integrate seamlessly with your PowerBrief workflow:

1. **Content Creation**: Creators submit concepts via public share links
2. **Review Process**: Notifications alert reviewers of new submissions
3. **Feedback Loop**: Revision requests are automatically communicated
4. **Approval**: Approved concepts trigger notifications with upload links
5. **Publishing**: Final ad launches are reported with performance links

This ensures your entire team stays informed throughout the creative and advertising process.

## Best Practices

### Channel Organization
- Use dedicated channels for different notification types to reduce noise
- Consider creating channels like:
  - `#creative-submissions` for new concept submissions
  - `#creative-feedback` for revision requests
  - `#creative-approvals` for approved concepts
  - `#ad-launches` for published ads

### Team Setup
- Invite relevant team members to appropriate channels
- Use channel-specific notifications to ensure the right people are alerted
- Consider using different channels for different brands if you manage multiple

### Notification Management
- Test your webhook setup before going live
- Regularly review and update channel configurations
- Monitor notification volume and adjust channels as needed
