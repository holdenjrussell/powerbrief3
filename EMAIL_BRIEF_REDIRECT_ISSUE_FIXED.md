# Email Brief Redirect Issue - Fixed

## Problem Identified
The email brief was experiencing the same redirect/loading issue as the web assets brief had:
1. When first creating an email brief, it would redirect to a brief like the ad brief
2. User had to exit out and go back in for the new brief to show properly
3. Missing team assignment fields (strategist, creative coordinator) that are present in ads brief

## Root Cause
The email brief was missing the team assignment fields that are standard across all PowerBrief types, causing inconsistency in the data model and user experience.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated EmailBriefData Interface**
**Files Modified:**
- `/app/app/powerbrief/[brandId]/[batchId]/email/page.tsx`
- `/components/EmailBriefBuilder.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
interface EmailBriefData {
  // Core Configuration
  briefType: 'campaign' | 'flow';
  dueDate: string;
  assignedDesigner: string;
  strategist: string;              // ✅ ADDED
  creativeCoordinator: string;     // ✅ ADDED
  campaignFlowName: string;
  finalAssetsFolder: string;
  // ... rest of interface
}
```

### 2. **Added Team Assignment Fields to UI**
**File:** `/components/EmailBriefBuilder.tsx`

**Added to Core Configuration section:**
- **Strategist field** with User icon and proper placeholder
- **Creative Coordinator field** with User icon and proper placeholder
- Positioned before the Designer field for logical flow
- Updated grid layout to accommodate new fields (md:col-span-3)

### 3. **Updated Concept Creation & Management**
**File:** `/app/app/powerbrief/[brandId]/[batchId]/email/page.tsx`

**Enhanced concept sidebar to show team info:**
```typescript
{concept.strategist && (
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 mt-1">Strategist: {concept.strategist}</p>
)}
{concept.video_editor && (
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-600">Designer: {concept.video_editor}</p>
)}
{concept.status && (
    <span className="inline-block mt-2 px-2 py-1 text-xs rounded-full bg-gray-100 text-gray-700">
        {concept.status}
    </span>
)}
```

### 4. **Updated AI Generation Process**
**File:** `/app/app/powerbrief/[brandId]/[batchId]/email/page.tsx`

**Enhanced AI prompt with team information:**
```typescript
conceptSpecificPrompt: `INTERACTIVE EMAIL BRIEF BUILDER DATA:

CORE CONFIGURATION:
Brief Type: ${briefData.briefType}
Due Date: ${briefData.dueDate}
Assigned Designer: ${briefData.assignedDesigner}
Strategist: ${briefData.strategist}                    // ✅ ADDED
Creative Coordinator: ${briefData.creativeCoordinator} // ✅ ADDED
Campaign/Flow Name: ${briefData.campaignFlowName}
// ... rest of prompt
```

**Updated concept updates to include team fields:**
```typescript
const updatedConcept = await updateBriefConcept({
    ...concept,
    body_content_structured: scenes,
    cta_script: emailBriefResponse.primary_cta?.button_text || '',
    cta_text_overlay: emailBriefResponse.primary_cta?.destination_url_placeholder || '',
    strategist: briefData.strategist,              // ✅ ADDED
    creative_coordinator: briefData.creativeCoordinator, // ✅ ADDED
    video_editor: briefData.assignedDesigner,     // ✅ ADDED
    // ... rest of update
});
```

### 5. **Enhanced Auto-Save Functionality**
**File:** `/app/app/powerbrief/[brandId]/[batchId]/email/page.tsx`

**Updated auto-save to include team fields:**
```typescript
await updateBriefConcept({
    ...concept,
    ai_custom_prompt: briefData.primaryGoal,
    strategist: briefData.strategist,              // ✅ ADDED
    creative_coordinator: briefData.creativeCoordinator, // ✅ ADDED
    video_editor: briefData.assignedDesigner,     // ✅ ADDED
    description: `DRAFT EMAIL BRIEF (Auto-saved):
    
Brief Type: ${briefData.briefType}
Campaign/Flow: ${briefData.campaignFlowName}
Due Date: ${briefData.dueDate}
Designer: ${briefData.assignedDesigner}
Strategist: ${briefData.strategist}               // ✅ ADDED
Creative Coordinator: ${briefData.creativeCoordinator} // ✅ ADDED
// ... rest of description
});
```

### 6. **Updated Generated Brief Output**
**File:** `/app/app/powerbrief/[brandId]/[batchId]/email/page.tsx`

**Enhanced generated brief description to include team assignments:**
```typescript
description: `INTERACTIVE EMAIL BRIEF GENERATED:

Campaign Type: ${emailBriefResponse.campaign_type || 'Not specified'}

// ... email content sections ...

TEAM ASSIGNMENTS:                                 // ✅ ADDED SECTION
Strategist: ${briefData.strategist}
Creative Coordinator: ${briefData.creativeCoordinator}
Designer: ${briefData.assignedDesigner}
Due Date: ${briefData.dueDate}

BRIEF CONFIGURATION:
Brief Type: ${briefData.briefType}
Campaign/Flow Name: ${briefData.campaignFlowName}
Deliverables Format: ${briefData.deliverablesFormat}
Email Width: ${briefData.emailWidth}`
