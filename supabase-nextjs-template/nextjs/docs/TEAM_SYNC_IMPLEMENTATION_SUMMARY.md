## üìã Pre-Testing Checklist

Before running migrations, please verify:

1. **Backup Production Database** - Critical before migrations
2. **Review Migration Files** - Check for any environment-specific changes needed
3. **Test in Staging** - Run full test suite in staging environment
4. **Meta API Credentials** - Ensure Meta tokens are configured for scorecard

## üöÄ Testing Steps

1. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --include-all
   ```

2. **Verify Default Teams**:
   - Check all brands have 3 default teams
   - Verify existing users added to Creative Team

3. **Test Team Features**:
   - Create/edit/delete teams
   - Add/remove team members
   - Switch teams and verify filtering

4. **Test Team Sync**:
   - Create announcements for specific teams
   - Verify todos filter by team
   - Test cross-team functionality
