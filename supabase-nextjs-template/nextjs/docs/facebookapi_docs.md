# Insights API

Provides a single, consistent interface to retrieve ad statistics.

*   **Breakdowns** - Group results
*   **Action Breakdowns** - Understanding the response from action breakdowns.
*   **Async Jobs** - For requests with large results, use asynchronous jobs
*   **Limits and Best Practices** - Call limits, filtering and best practices.

Before you can get data on your ad's performance, you should set up your ads to track the metrics you are interested in. For that, you can use *URL Tags*, *Meta Pixel*, and the *Conversions API*.

## Before you begin

You will need:

*   The `ads_read` permission.
*   An app. See *Meta App Development* for more information.

## Campaign Statistics

To get the statistics of a campaign's last 7 day performance:

```bash
curl -G \
  -d "date_preset=last_7d" \
  -d "access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "https://graph.facebook.com/API_VERSION/AD_CAMPAIGN_ID/insights"
```

To learn more, see the *Ad Insights Reference*.

## Making Calls

The Insights API is available as an edge on any ads object.

### API Method

*   `act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights`
*   `<CAMPAIGN_ID>/insights`
*   `<ADSET_ID>/insights`
*   `<AD_ID>/insights`

### Request

You can request specific fields with a comma-separated list in the `fields` parameters. For example:

```bash
curl -G \
-d "fields=impressions" \
-d "access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/<AD_ID>/insights"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "impressions": "2466376",
      "date_start": "2009-03-28",
      "date_stop": "2016-04-01"
    }
  ],
  "paging": {
    "cursors": {
      "before": "MAZDZD",
      "after": "MAZDZD"
    }
  }
}
```

## Levels

Aggregate results at a defined object level. This automatically deduplicates data.

### Request

For example, get a campaign's insights on ad level.

```bash
curl -G \
-d "level=ad" \
-d "fields=impressions,ad_id" \
-d "access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/CAMPAIGN_ID/insights"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "impressions": "9708",
      "ad_id": "6142546123068",
      "date_start": "2009-03-28",
      "date_stop": "2016-04-01"
    },
    {
      "impressions": "18841",
      "ad_id": "6142546117828",
      "date_start": "2009-03-28",
      "date_stop": "2016-04-01"
    }
  ],
  "paging": {
    "cursors": {
      "before": "MAZDZD",
      "after": "MQZDZD"
    }
  }
}
```

If you don't have access to all ad objects at the requested level, the insights call returns no data. For example, while requesting insights with `level` set to `ad`, if you don't have access to one or more ad objects under the ad account, this API call will return a permission error.

## Attribution windows

The *conversion attribution window* provides timeframes that define when we attribute an event to an ad on a Meta app. For background information, see *Meta Business Help Center, About attribution windows*. We measure the actions that occur when a conversion event occurs and look back in time 1-day and 7-days. To view actions attributed to different attribution windows, make a request to `/{ad-account-id}/insights`. If you do not provide `action_attribution_windows` we use `7d_click` and provide it under `value`.

For example, specify `action_attribution_windows` and 'value' is fixed at `7d_click` attribution window. Make a request to `act_10151816772662695/insights?action_attribution_windows=['1d_click','1d_view']` and get this result:

```json
"spend": 2352.45,
"actions": [
{
"action_type": "link_click",
"value": 6608,
"1d_view": 86,
"1d_click": 6510
},
"cost_per_action_type": [
{
"action_type": "link_click",
"value": 0.35600030266344,
"1d_view": 27.354069767442,
"1d_click": 0.36135944700461
},
```

// if attribution window is *not* specified in query. And note that the number under 'value' key is the same even if attribution window is specified.
// act_10151816772662695/insights

```json
"spend": 2352.45,
"actions": [
{
"action_type": "link_click",
"value": 6608
},
"cost_per_action_type": [
{
"action_type": "link_click",
"value": 0.35600030266344
},
```

curl -G \
-d "fields=id,name,insights{unique_clicks,cpm,total_actions}" \
-d "level=ad" \
-d 'filtering=[{"field":"ad.adlabels","operator":"ANY", "value":["Label Name"]}]'  \
-d 'time_range={"since":"2015-03-01","until":"2015-03-31"}' \

      "total_actions": 49,
      "date_start": "2015-03-01",
      "date_stop": "2015-03-31",
    },
  ],
  "paging": {
    "cursors": {
      "before": "MA==",
      "after": "MA==",
    }
  }
}
```

## Clicks definition

To better understand the click metrics that Meta offers today, please read the definitions and usage of each below:

*   **Link Clicks**, `actions:link_click` - The number of clicks on ad links to select destinations or experiences, on or off Meta-owned properties. See *Ads Help Center, Link Clicks*.
*   **Clicks (All)**, `clicks` - The metric counts multiple types of clicks on your ad, including certain types of interactions with the ad container, links to other destinations, and links to expanded ad experiences. See *Ads Help Center, Clicks(All)*.

## Deleted and Archived Objects

Ad units may be `DELETED` or `ARCHIVED`. The stats of deleted or archived objects appear when you query their parents. This means if you query `impressions` at the ad set level, results include `impressions` from all ads in the set, regardless of whether the ads are in a deleted or archived state. See also, *Storing and Retrieving Ad Objects Best Practice*.

However, if you query using filtering, status filtering will be applied by default to return only Active objects. As a result, the total stats of the parent node may be greater than the stats of its children.

You can get the stats of `ARCHIVED` objects from their parent nodes though, by providing an extra `filtering` parameter.

### Request (Archived)

To get the stats of all `ARCHIVED` ads in an ad account listed one by one:

```bash
curl -G \
  -d "level=ad" \
  -d "filtering=[{'field':'ad.effective_status','operator':'IN','value':['ARCHIVED']}]" \
  -d "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  "https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/insights/"
```

### Response (Archived)

Note that only archived objects are returned in this response.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "impressions": "1741",
      "date_start": "2016-03-11",
      "date_stop": "2016-03-12"
    }
  ],
  "paging": {
    "cursors": {
      "before": "MAZDZD",
      "after": "MAZDZD"
    }
  }
}
```

### Deleted Objects Insights

You can query insights on deleted objects if you have their IDs or by using the `ad.effective_status` filter.

### Request (Deleted)

For example, if you have the ad set ID:

```bash
curl -G \
-d "fields=id,name,status,insights{impressions}" \
-d "access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/AD_SET_ID"
```

In this example, we query with `ad.effective_status`:

```bash
POST https://graph.facebook.com/<VERSION>/act_ID/insights?access_token=token&appsecret_proof=proof&fields=ad_id,impressions&date_preset=lifetime&level=ad&filtering=[{"field":"ad.effective_status","operator":"IN","value":["DELETED"]}]
```

### Response (Deleted)

```json
{
  "id": "6042147342661",
  "name": "My Like Campaign",
  "status": "DELETED",
  "insights": {
    "data": [
      {
        "impressions": "1741",
        "date_start": "2016-03-11",
        "date_stop": "2016-03-12"
      }
    ],
    "paging": {
      "cursors": {
        "before": "MAZDZD",
        "after": "MAZDZD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timeouts

The most common issues causing failure at this endpoint are too many requests and time outs:

*   On `/GET` or synchronous requests, you can get out-of-memory or timeout errors.
*   On `/POST` or asynchronous requests, you can possibly get timeout errors. For asynchronous requests, it can take up to an hour to complete a request including retry attempts. For example if you make a query that tries to fetch large volume of data for many ad level objects.

#### Recommendations

*   There is no explicit limit for when a query will fail. When it times out, try to break down the query into smaller queries by putting in filters like date range.
*   Unique metrics are time consuming to compute. Try to query unique metrics in a separate call to improve performance of non-unique metrics.

### Rate Limiting

The Meta Insights API utilizes rate limiting to ensure an optimal reporting experience for all of our partners. For more information and suggestions, see our Insights API *Limits & Best Practices*.

### Discrepancy with Ads Manager

Beginning June 10, 2025, to reduce discrepancies with Meta Ads Manager, `use_unified_attribution_setting` and `action_report_time` parameters will be disregarded and API responses will mimic Ads Manager settings:

*   Attributed values will be based on Ad-Set-level attribution settings (similar to `use_unified_attribution_setting=true`), and inline/on-ad actions will be included in `1d_click` or `1d_view` attribution window data. After this change, standalone `inline` attribution window data will no longer be returned.
*   Actions will be reported using `action_report_time=mixed`: on-Meta actions (like Link Clicks) will use impression-based reporting time; whereas off-Meta actions (like Web Purchases) will leverage conversion-based reporting time.

The default behavior of the API is different from the default behavior in Ads Manager. If you would like to observe the same behavior as in Ads Manager, please set the field `use_unified_attribution_setting` to true.

# Insights API Breakdowns

You can group the Insights API results into different sets using breakdowns.

The Insights API can return several metrics that are estimated, in development, or both. Insights breakdown values are estimated. For more information, see *Insights API, Estimated and Deprecated Metrics*.

## Limitations

### Unavailable fields

The following fields cannot be requested when specifying a breakdown:

*   `app_store_clicks`
*   `newsfeed_avg_position`
*   `newsfeed_clicks`
*   `relevance_score`
*   `newsfeed_impressions`

### Restrictions for Off-Meta Action Metrics

The following breakdowns will no longer be available for off-Meta action metrics.

**Type 1**

*   `region`
*   `dma`
*   `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone`
*   `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone`

**Type 2**

*   `action_device`
*   `action_destination`
*   `action_target_id`
*   `product_id`
*   `action_carousel_card_id`/`action_carousel_card_name`
*   `action_canvas_component_name`

**Rules related to queries containing above breakdowns:**

*   *Type 1* — The Insights API will not return unsupported offsite metrics (e.g., actions metric with Type 1 breakdowns).
*   *Type 2* — Offsite web metrics will continue to be returned from the API, however will not contain the breakdown value. The mobile metrics will not be returned anymore when queried with these breakdowns.

*Note:* The breakdowns listed above will still be supported for on-Meta metrics such as impressions, link clicks, etc. The changes will also not impact historical data prior to April 27, 2021; breakdowns for historical data will continue to be available.

### Action Metrics

Metrics will not be available under the following scenarios:

*   When there is an attempted aggregation across multiple attribution settings
*   When requested with impacted breakdowns (this restriction only applies for off-Meta & action types).

*Note:* Metrics will be available if querying with `action_attribution_windows=1d_click,7d_click,1d_view` (not including the default window).

## Generic Breakdowns

The following breakdowns are available.

| Breakdown                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Notes

*   Filtering `app_id` and `skan_conversion_id` using the `filtering` field is currently not supported.
*   The `dma` breakdown is not available for the `estimated_ad_recall_rate` metric or `video_thruplay_watched_actions` metric.
*   The `dma` breakdown employs a sampling methodology to compute unique metrics like reach. In instances where there are a large number of DMA regions with comparatively low volumes, they might not be represented in the sample or could be scaled up to a power of 2. Therefore, it's advisable to query the corresponding impressions as well for enhanced accuracy.
*   `frequency_value` is used with `reach` only. For example, how frequently a unique user saw an ad.
*   By design, `image_asset` and `video_asset` breakdowns are not available at the ad account level for assets used in *Dynamic Creative*.
*   Ad actions `video_p25_watched_actions`, `video_p50_watched_actions`, `video_p75_watched_actions`, `video_p95_watched_actions`, and `video_p100_watched_actions` do not support `region` breakdown.
*   All Dynamic Creative asset breakdowns only support a limited set of metrics:

## Hourly Breakdowns

Hourly stats are now an available breakdown using the following breakdowns:

*   `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone`
*   `hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone`

See *Combining Breakdowns* for limits on number of breakdowns you may request with the hourly breakdown. Hourly breakdowns do not support unique fields, which are any fields prepended with `unique_*`, `reach` or `frequency`. `reach` and `frequency` fields will return 0 when hourly breakdowns are in use.

```bash
curl -G \
-d "fields=impressions" \
-d "breakdowns=hourly_stats_aggregated_by_audience_time_zone" \
-d "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<AD_CAMPAIGN_ID>/insights"
```

## Action Breakdown

Group results in the `actions` field. You can use the following breakdowns for `action_breakdowns`:

The following are the possible breakdowns that can be supplied into the `action_breakdowns` field.

*   `action_device`
*   `conversion_destination`
*   `matched_persona_id`
*   `matched_persona_name`
*   `signal_source_bucket`
*   `standard_event_content_type`
*   `action_canvas_component_name`
*   `action_carousel_card_id`
*   `action_carousel_card_name`
*   `action_destination`
*   `action_reaction`
*   `action_target_id`
*   `action_type`
*   `action_video_sound`
*   `action_video_type`

If `action_breakdowns` parameter is not specified, `action_type` is implicitly added as the `action_breakdowns`.

### Total Count in `actions`

The total count (sum) of all values returned in group results (actions).

This result may not equal `total_actions` since fields returned in `actions` are hierarchical and include detailed actions not counted.

```
total_actions - 33
    page_engagement - 10
        post_engagement - 10
            link_click - 2
            comment - 3
            post_reaction - 3
            like - 2
    mobile_app_install - 12
    app_custom_event - 11
        app_custom_event.fb_mobile_activate_app - 6
        app_custom_event.other - 5
```

In this example, `post_engagement` is a sum of `link_click`, `comment`, `like`, and `post_reaction`, where `post_reaction` is the count of all reactions, including likes. The `total_actions` field represents a sum of top-level actions for an object, such as `page_engagement`, `mobile_app_install`, and `app_custom_event`.

## Combining Breakdowns

Due to storage constraints, only some permutations of breakdowns are available. Permutations marked with an asterisk (*) can be joined with `action_type`, `action_target_id` and `action_destination` which is the name for `action_target_id`.

# Insights API Asynchronous Jobs

Fetch stats on many objects and apply filtering and sorting; we made the asynchronous workflow simpler:

1.  Send a `POST` request to `<AD_OBJECT>/insights` endpoint, which responds with the `id` of an `Ad Report Run`.

    ```json
    {
      "report_run_id": 6023920149050,
    }
    ```

    Do not store the `report_run_id` for long term use, it expires after 30 days.
2.  Ad Report Runs contain information about this asynchronous job, such as `async_status`. Poll this field until `async_status` is `Job Completed` and `async_percent_completion` is `100`.

    ```json
    {
      "id": "6044775548468",
      "account_id": "1010035716096012",
      "time_ref": 1459788928,
      "time_completed": 1459788990,
      "async_status": "Job Completed",
      "async_percent_completion": 100
    }
    ```
3.  Then you can query `<AD_REPORT_RUN_ID>/insights` edge to fetch the final result.

    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "impressions": "9708",
          "date_start": "2009-03-28",
          "date_stop": "2016-04-04"
        },
        {
          "impressions": "18841",
          "date_start": "2009-03-28",
          "date_stop": "2016-04-04"
        }
      ],
      "paging": {
        "cursors": {
          "before": "MAZDZD",
          "after": "MQZDZD"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

This job gets all stats for the account and returns an asynchronous job ID:

```bash
curl \
  -F 'level=campaign' \
  -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/insights
```

```bash
curl -G \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/1000002
```

```bash
curl -G \
  -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/1000003/insights
```

## Async Job Status

| Status         | Description                                      |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Job Not Started | Job has not started yet.                         |
| Job Started    | Job has been started, but is not yet running.    |
| Job Running    | Job has started running.                         |
| Job Completed  | Job has successfully completed.                  |
| Job Failed     | Job has failed. Review your query and try again. |
| Job Skipped    | Job has expired and skipped. Please resubmit your job and try again. |

## Export Reports

We provide a convenience endpoint for exporting `<AD_REPORT_RUN_ID>` to a localized human-readable format.

*Note*: this endpoint is not part of our versioned Graph API and therefore does not conform to its breaking-change policy. Scripts and programs should not rely on the format of the result as it may change unexpectedly.

```bash
curl -G \
  -d 'report_run_id=<AD_REPORT_RUN_ID>' \
  -d 'name=myreport' \
  -d 'format=xls' \
'https://www.facebook.com/ads/ads_insights/export_report/'
```

| Name           | Description                                                         |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name` string  | Name of downloaded file                                             |
| `format` enum{csv,xls} | Format of file                                                    |
| `report_run_id` integer | ID of report to run                                                 |
| `access_token` string  | Permissions granted by the logged-in user. Provide this to export reports for another user. |

# Limits and Best Practices

Beginning June 10, 2025, to improve overall API performance, `reach` will no longer be returned for standard queries that apply `breakdowns` and use `start_dates` more than 13 months old. (Responses to such requests will omit `reach` and related fields, such as `frequency` and `cpp`.)

To apply `breakdowns` and still retrieve >13-month-old `reach` values, you can use asynchronous jobs to make up to 20 requests per Ad Account per day. Check the `x-Fb-Ads-Insights-Reach-Throttle` header to monitor how close you are to that rate-limit, and note that once the rate-limit is breached, requests will omit `reach` and related fields.

Facebook Insights API provides performance data from Facebook marketing campaigns. To protect system performance and stability, we have protective measures to equally distribute system resources among applications. All policies we describe below are subject to change.

## Data Per Call Limits

We use data-per-call limits to prevent a query from retrieving too much data beyond what the system can handle. There are 2 types of data limits:

1.  By number of rows in response, and
2.  By number of data points required to compute the total, such as summary row.

These limits apply to both sync and async `/insights` calls, and we return an error:

`error_code = 100, CodeException (error subcode: 1487534)`

### Best Practices, Data Per Call Limits

*   Limit your query by limiting the date range or number of ad ids. You can also limit your query to metrics that are necessary, or break it down into multiple queries with each requesting a subset of metrics.
*   Avoid account-level queries that include high cardinality breakdowns such as `action_target_id` or `product_id`, and wider date ranges like lifetime.
*   Use `/insights` edge directly with lower level ad objects to retrieve granular data for that level. For example, first use the account-level query to fetch the list of lower-level object ids with `level` and `filtering` parameters. In this example, we fetch all campaigns that recorded some impressions:

    ```bash
    curl -G \
    -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -d 'level=campaign' \
    -d 'filtering=[{field:"ad.impressions",operator:"GREATER_THAN",value:0}]' \
    'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.7/act_<ACCOUNT_ID>/insights'
    ```
*   We can then use `/<campaign_id>/insights` with each returned value to query and *batch the insights requests* for these campaigns in a single call:

    ```bash
    curl \
    -F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -F 'batch=[ \
      { \
        "method": "GET", \
        "relative_url": "v23.0/<CAMPAIGN_ID_1>/insights?fields=impressions,spend,ad_id,adset_id&level=ad" \
      }, \
      { \
        "method": "GET", \
        "relative_url": "v23.0/<CAMPAIGN_ID_2>/insights?fields=impressions,spend,ad_id,adset_id&level=ad" \
      }, \
      { \
        "method": "GET", \
        "relative_url": "v23.0/<CAMPAIGN_ID_3>/insights?fields=impressions,spend,ad_id,adset_id&level=ad" \
      } \
    ]' \
    'https://graph.facebook.com'
    ```
*   Use `filtering` parameter only to retrieve insights for ad objects with data. The field value specified in `filtering` uses DOT notation to denote the fields under the object. Please note that filtering with `STARTS_WITH` and `CONTAIN` does not change the summary data. In this case, use the `IN` operator. See example of a `filtering` request:

    ```bash
    curl -G \
    -d 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -d 'level=ad' \
    -d 'filtering=[{field:"ad.impressions",operator:"GREATER_THAN",value:0},]' \
    'https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/act_<ACCOUNT_ID>/insights'
    ```
*   Use `date_preset` if possible. Custom date ranges are less efficient to run in our system.
*   Use *batch requests* for multiple sync calls and async to query for large volume of data to avoid timeouts.
*   Try sync calls first and then use async calls in cases where sync calls timeout
*   Insights refresh every 15 minutes and do not change after 28 days of being reported

## Insights Call Load Limits

Ninety days from the release of v3.3 and effective for all public versions, we change the ad account level rate limit to better reflect the volume of API calls needed. We compute the rate limit quota on your Marketing API access tier and the business owning your app. see *Access and Authentication*. This change applies to all Ads Insights API endpoints: `GET {adaccount_ID}/insights`, `GET {campaign_ID}/insights`, `GET {adset_ID}/insights`, `GET {ad_ID}/insights`, `POST {adaccount_ID}/insights`, `POST {campaign_ID}/insights`, `POST {adset_ID}/insights`, `POST {ad_ID}/insights`.

We use load limits for optimal reporting experience. We measure API calls for their rate as well as the resources they require. We allow a fixed load limit per application per second. When you exceed that limit, your requests fail.

Check the `x-fb-ads-insights-throttle` HTTP header in every API response to know how close your app is to its limit as well as to estimate how heavy a particular query may be. Insights calls are also subject to the default ad account limits shown in the `x-ad-account-usage` HTTP header. More details can be found here *Marketing API, Best Practices*.

Once an app reaches its limit, the call gets an error response with `error_code = 4, CodedException`. You should stay well below your limit. If your app reaches its allowed limits, only a certain percentage of requests go through, depending on the query, and the rate.

We apply rate limiting to each app sending synchronous and asynchronous `/insights` calls combined. The two main parameters limits are counted against are by application, and by ad account.

Here's an example of the HTTP header with an application's accrued score as a percentage of the limits:

`X-FB-Ads-Insights-Throttle: { "app_id_util_pct": 100, "acc_id_util_pct": 10, "ads_api_access_tier": "standard_access" }`

The header "x-fb-ads-insights-throttle" is a JSON value containing these info:

*   `app_id_util_pct` — The percentage of allocated capacity for the associated app_id has consumed.
*   `acc_id_util_pct` — The percentage of allocated capacity for the associated ad account_id has consumed.
*   `ads_api_access_tier` — Tiers allows your app to access the Marketing API. `standard_access` enables lower rate limiting.

### Global Rate Limits

During periods of elevated global load to the `/insights` endpoint, the system can throttle requests to protect the backend. This can occur in rare cases when too many queries of high complexity (large time ranges, complex metrics, and/or high number of ad object IDs) are coming at the same time. This will manifest in an error that looks like this:

`error_code = 4, CodeException (error subcode: 1504022), error_title: Too many API requests`

During these periods, it is advised to reduce calls, wait a short period, and query again.

### Rate Limits Best Practices

*   Sending several queries at once are more likely to trigger our rate limiting. Try to spread your `/insights` queries by pacing them with wait time in your job.
*   Use the rate information in the HTTP response header to moderate your calls. Add a back-off mechanism to slow down or pause your `/insights` queries when you come close to hitting 100% utility for your application, or for your ad account.
*   We report ad insights data in the ad account's timezone. To retrieve insights data for the associated ad account daily, consider the time of day using the account timezone. This helps pace queries throughout the day.
*   Check the `ads_api_access_tier` that allows you to access the Marketing API. By default, apps are in the `development_access` tier and `standard_access` enables lower rate limiting. To get a higher rate limit and get to the standard tier, you can apply for the "Advanced Access" to the *Ads Management Standard Access* feature.

# Ad Insights

Provides a single, consistent interface to retrieve an ad's statistics. See *Insights*. The Insights API can return several metrics which are *estimated* or *in-development*. In some cases a metric may be *both* estimated and in-development.

*   *Estimated* - Provide directional insights for outcomes that are hard to precisely quantify. They may evolve as we gather more data. See *Ads Help Center, Estimated metrics*.
*   *In Development* - Still being tested and may change as we improve our methodologies. We encourage you to use it for directional guidance, but please use caution when using it for historical comparisons or strategic planning. See *Ads Help Center, In development metrics*.

For more information, see *Insights API, Estimated and Deprecated Metrics*.

Facebook will no longer be able to aggregate non-inline conversion metric values across iOS 14.5 and non-iOS 14.5 campaigns due to differences in attribution logic. Querying across iOS 14.5 and non-iOS 14.5 campaigns will result in no data getting returned for non-inline conversion metrics such as app installs and purchases. Inline event metrics like impressions, link clicks, and video views, however, can still be aggregated. Please visit our *changelog* for more information.

The `date_preset = lifetime` parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with `date_preset = maximum`, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, `date_preset = maximum` will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any `lifetime` calls will default to `maximum` and return only 37 months of data.

## Reading (GET)

Provides insights on your advertising performance. Allows for deduped metrics across child objects, such as `unique_clicks`, sorting of metrics, and async reporting.

### Example

```http
GET /v23.0/<AD_SET_ID>/insights?fields=impressions&breakdown=publisher_platform HTTP/1.1

| `fidelity_type` string                                | To differentiate StoreKit-rendered ads from view-through ads, SKAdNetwork defines a fidelity-type parameter, which you include in the ad signature and receive in the install-validation postback. Use a fidelity-type value of `1` for StoreKit-rendered ads and attributable web ads, and `0` for view-through ads.<br>*Note*: This breakdown is only supported by the `total_postbacks_detailed_v4` field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Default value is ["action_type"].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `time_increment` enum{monthly, all_days} or integer | Default value: `all_days`<br><br>If it is an integer, it is the number of days from 1 to 90. After you pick a reporting period by using `time_range` or `date_preset`, you may choose to have the results for the whole period, or have results for smaller time slices. If "all_days" is used, it means one result set for the whole period. If "monthly" is used, you will get one result set for each calendar month in the given period. Or you can have one result set for each N-day period specified by this param. This param is ignored if `time_ranges` is specified.                                                                                                           |
| `time_range` {'since':YYYY-MM-DD,'until':YYYY-MM-DD} | A single time range object. UNIX timestamp not supported. This param is ignored if `time_ranges` is provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `time_ranges` list<{'since':YYYY-MM-DD,'until':YYYY-MM-DD}> | Array of time range objects. Time ranges can overlap, for example to return cumulative insights. Each time range will have one result set. You cannot have more granular results with `time_increment` setting in this case.If `time_ranges` is specified, `date_preset`, `time_range` and `time_increment` are ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `use_account_attribution_setting` boolean | Default value: `false`<br><br>When this parameter is set to true, your ads results will be shown using the attribution settings defined for the ad account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
