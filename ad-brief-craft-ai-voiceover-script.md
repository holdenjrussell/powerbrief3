## Introduction
Welcome to Ad Brief Craft AI, the all-in-one platform for streamlining your advertising creative process. Our platform combines powerful brand management, creative brief generation, and content creation tools with AI assistance at every step. Let's take a tour of the key features and workflows.

## PowerBrief - Brand Management

### Main Brand Dashboard
When you first log in, you'll land on our main brand dashboard. This is your central hub for managing all your brand assets and campaigns. Here, you can see all your existing brands displayed as cards with quick access to their details.

To create a new brand, click the "Add New Brand" button in the top right corner. Enter your brand name in the dialog, and we'll set up the framework for your brand information.

### Brand Details
After selecting a brand, you'll be taken to the brand details page. This is where you'll input critical information about your brand including:

- Brand positioning
- Product details
- Key technologies
- Customer testimonials
- Health benefits
- Target audience summary
- Brand voice guidelines
- Competitive advantages

Take time to complete these sections thoroughly as they'll inform all creative work generated through the platform.

### Target Audience Section
The target audience section allows you to define specific demographics including:
- Gender breakdown
- Age ranges

The more detailed your audience information, the better your AI-generated content will align with your ideal customers.

This information helps our AI understand your unique selling propositions and avoid creative approaches that might be too similar to competitors.

## Managing Batches

### Creating Batches
Batches allow you to organize your creative projects. Click "Create New Batch" to start a new campaign or creative initiative. Each batch can have its own specific objectives, timeline, and creative direction.

### Batch Settings
In the batch settings, you can:
- Set campaign objectives
- Define key performance indicators

### Organizing Concepts
Within each batch, you'll create individual concepts. Think of concepts as specific ad ideas or creative executions that will be developed further in the production process.

## Concept Creation

### AI Voice Generation
One of our most powerful features is the AI voice generation tool. Here's how to use it:

1. Navigate to the concept you want to create a voiceover for
2. Click on the "AI Voiceover Generator" tab
3. Select from our library of voice options
4. Choose your preferred voice model - we offer multiple quality levels
5. Adjust voice settings like speed, stability, and similarity
6. Click "Generate Voice" to create your AI voiceover

You can customize voice parameters to get exactly the tone and pacing you need:
- Use the speed slider to adjust how quickly the voice speaks
- The stability slider controls how consistent the voice remains
- The similarity slider affects how closely the voice matches the original sample

Once generated, you can play back your voiceover, download it for local use, or save it directly to your project library.

### Public Share Links
Need to share your concept with external stakeholders? Our public share link feature makes it easy:

1. Find the "Share" button on your concept
2. Click to generate a public link

## Ad Review Process

### Submitting for Review
When your concept is ready for review:
1. Navigate to the concept details page
2. Click "Submit for Review"

### Approval Process
Reviewers have two primary actions:
1. Approve - This moves the concept to production

When requesting revisions, reviewers must provide notes explaining what changes are needed.

## UGC Pipeline
